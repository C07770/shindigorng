FROM 1.0.x TO 1.1.x
===================

Almost all interfaces have been updated from 1.0.x -> 1.1.x.  The 
following information is not complete.

== container.js config changes ==

* gadgets.parentOrigins: Default ["*"]

An array of valid origin domains for the container.

== Java Interface Changes ==

* AbstractContainerConfig

Changed signature on getMap() and getList() to use Java
generics.

* SecurityToken

New methods: getExpiresAt() and isExpired() are now required.  A new AbstractSecurityToken
base class is available.

* SecurityTokenDecoder 

The interface and implementation are replaced
with the new SecurityTokenCodec interface and implementations.

You will need to adjust any custom SecurityToken decoders to 
encode tokens as well as decode them.


== Java Guice Changes ==

1.1.x uses Guice 2.0 which allows for @Provides annotations and much more.

* TemplateModule

If you had previously customized the Set of TagHandlers you'll need to start
using Guice Multibindings instead.  This is much easier than subclassing the
Guice module.  Here's what you would add to your local module to add a new 
Tag handler.

  Multibinder.newSetBinder(binder(), TagHandler.class).addBinding().to(MyCustomTagHandler.class);

== PHP Changes ==

TBD
